Your task is to translate this technical document into approachable language.
Convert the following text to simpler language in a conversational tone.
Replace technical or complex terms with simpler alternatives (add brief parenthetical explanations if needed).

Please do the following:
1. Remove all authors, human names, figure or table references (e.g. "Figure 1", "Table of Contents"), headings, section numbers, and table-of-contents lists.
2. Do not include any markdown or formatting symbols (no hashes, asterisks, etc.).
3. Return only plain text, nothing else.
4. Do not summarize or reference the text; just convert it directly to simpler language while preserving as much original context as possible.
5. Make the text suitable for a podcast, so it should read naturally aloud, return only readable paragraphs that can be read aloud in a human voice.
